Hey Ya'll.

It's been forever sense a post, but this isn't an active blog so no one cares!

I haven't gotten my publishing workflow down yet, but I took some downtime at the Apple Store to ssh in and work some blog post magic.

I'm writing this from one of the new thinner retina Macbook Pros.

The screen looks pretty nice but the thing is huge.

I have to cocur with the people that say you can't really tell the difference, but that doesn't make me want this less.

Ok time to see if I can remember how to deploy this back up to github.
